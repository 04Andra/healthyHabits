<p><b>HealthyHabits</b> is an application in which I wanted to motivate people to exercise more, through a set of
 exercises and prizes won. Using an api, the user can choose the type of exercises he wants to do that day,
 and after 7 days of training, he receives a healthy food recipe.  </p>
<p>The idea for this application came to me when I entered the "world of sports" and I didn't have the basic knowledge to handle myself, and an application like this would have helped me a lot.</p>
